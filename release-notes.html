<li> <u>1.41a, 21 April 2008</u>
<ul>
<li> The Java version is displayed in the status bar on startup.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused images saved in TIFF format to have their
contents shifted left if the "Info" property was set to an empty string.
<li> Fixed a bug, introduced in v1.40c,  that caused stacks saved in TIFF format to have their
contents shifted left if any slice had a blank label and all
other slice labels where null.

<li> The <i>Duplicate</i>, <i>Scale</i>, <i>Adjust&gt;Size</i>, <i>Z Project</i>,
<i>Reduce Dimensionality</i>, <i>Image Calculator</i>,  <i>Make Binary</i> and 
<i>Convert to Mask</i> commands now work
correctly with hyperstacks that have custom channel LUTs.
<li> The <i>Edit&gt;Copy to System</i> command works with composite color images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the setAutoThreshold() macro function to sometimes
not produce the same result as the "Auto" button in the "Threshold" window.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the getLut() macro function to throw an exception
when attempting to retrieve a LUT from a composite image in batch mode
