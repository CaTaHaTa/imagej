<li> <u>1.41d, 28 May 2008</u>
<ul>
<li> Mark Longair contributed the <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Find Commands</i>
command, which provides a dialog for interactively finding ImageJ commands by
typing a substring of the command name. One can simply type "l" (launch), a few
letters for disambiguation and then 'enter' to run the matching command.
<li> Gabriel Landini contributed an improved version of 
<i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;File Holes</i> that is up to 100 times faster.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Make Montage</i> command now
works with composite color images.
<li> Enable the "Save TIFF and Raw in Intel Byte Order" option in
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Input/Output</i> to save images
as little-endian TIFF files.
<li> <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;PNG</i> saves 8, 16 and 32 bit images as 8-bit PNGs, and it
now works with composite color images.
<li> Changed the "GIF Transparent Index (0-255)" field in <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Input/Output</i> 
to "GIF and PNG Transparent Index".
<li> The "<" and ">" keys and the mouse wheel now change hyperstack channels.
<li> Added the "Copy Row Numbers" option to the 
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Input/Output</i> dialog box.
<li> Changed the Results window
<i>File&gt;Set File Extension</i> menu item to <i>File&gt;Options</i>.
<li> Right-clicking on a macro tool runs a macro with the name &lt;tool name&gt;+" Options".
<li> DICOM IMPLICIT_VR tags with a length less than 4 are now displayed in the <i>Image&gt;Show Info</i>
window.
<li> Added the <i>Neuron (1.6M, 5 channels)</i> sample image,
which was contributed by John Alexander. Open the image and
press "i" (<i>Image&gt;Show Info</i>) to get a description.
<li> Added the getStringWidth(string) macro function.
<li> Added getBufferedImage() methods to the ImagePlus and ImageProcessor classes.
<li> Added a get16BitBufferedImage() method to the ShortProcessor class.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Crop </i> to fail with merged
composite images when using Java 1.6.
<li> Fixed a bugs in the Plot class (Plot.* macro functions) that caused
incorrect axis labeling if setLimits() was not called first and caused lines
and shapes wider than three pixels to sometimes be drawn outside the
plot frame.
<li> Fixed a bug in the imageCalculator() macro function that sometimes caused
the result image to not be the currently selected image.
<li> Fixed a bug in the setColor() macro function that caused it to always
convert the argument to an integer.
<li> Fixed a bug in the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> tool that
caused the "Auto" feature to not work correctly on images with line
selections.
