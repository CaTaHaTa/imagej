<ul>

window is now always updated when the B&C window is activated.

<i>Analyze&gt;Gels&gt;Select First Lane</i> command.
<li> An error message is displayed when a calibrated is opened and
"Global" calibration is enabled.

not open correctly.
<li> Added the getInfo("image.description") macro function.
<li> Added the ImportDialog.getLastFileInfo() method.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Import&gt;URL</i> to fail to open

<li> Fixed several bugs in <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Specify</i>, thanks to 
patches contributed by Joachim Wesner.
<li> Fixed a bug in <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> that could cause
a blank result if the source was an RGB image. the x scale was less
than 0.25 and the y scale was greater than 0.5.
