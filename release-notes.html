<li> <u>1.39f, 9 October 2007</u>
<ul>
<li> Michiel Schmid contributed an improved <i>Process&gt;Subtract Background</i>
command with new "Create Background", "Disable Smoothing" and "Preview" dialog options.
<li> Added the "Transparent2" mode (zero pixels are transparent) to
<i>Edit&gt;Paste Control</i>.
<li> Maximized windows use more of the screen on OS X and Windows.
<li> When shrinking selections, <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Enlarge</i> 
now works with selections touching the image edge.
<li> <i>File&gt;Revert</i> no longer deletes the selection.
<li> <i>Plugins&gt;Compile and Run</i> now runs compiled plugins
(.class files) without the Java compiler (usually in tools.jar) being present.
And, thanks to Johannes Schindelin, it uses
com.sun.tools.javac instead of the deprecated sun.tools.javac.
<li> On Linux, the preferences file (IJ_Prefs.txt) is saved in the .imagej 
directory and the menu font size is no longer set to 14 points.
<li> The ImageCanvas.setDisplayList(Vector) method now accepts a list
of ShapeRois with differing colors and line widths
(<a href="download/MultiColor_Graphic_Overlay.java">example</a>).
<li> Added the File.openAsRawString(path) macro function.
Refer to the
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/macros/First10Bytes.txt">First10Bytes</a>
and
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/macros/ZapGremlins.txt">ZapGremlins</a>
macros for examples.
<li> Added the COPY_ZERO_TRANSPARENT constant to the Blitter class.
<li> Added the IJ.isMacro() method, which returns true if a macro is running
or an IJ.run() method is executing.
<li> Added the getInstanceColor() and setStroke() methods to the Roi class.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause the imageCalculator() macro function
to return before the output window had opened.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause a boolean variable in a macro run() call
to trigger the inclusion of other boolean variables. 
<li> Fixed a bug that caused an exception if showProgress() was
called in a macro run from the command line using the -batch option.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause the image count to increase by one if
the setBatchMode(true) macro function was called twice in succession.
</ul>
