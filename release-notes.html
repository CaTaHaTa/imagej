with hyperstacks.
<li> Added a "Name" field to the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Images to Stack</i> dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, <i>Help&gt;Update ImageJ</i> updates ij.jar files
in non-standard locations, and those embedded in ImageJ64 on OS X.
<li> ImageJ can now be compiled with OpenJDK, thanks to 
Johannes Schindelin and Mark Longair.
<li> Added the doWand(x,y,tolerance,mode) macro function and
IJ.doWand(x,y,tolerance,mode) method.

with "ij" to sometimes not be found.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the Threshold tool "Apply" option to not be 
recorded for 32-bit images with "Set Background Pixels to NaN" enabled.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused uncompressed TIFF stacks larger than
2GB to not open correctly.
