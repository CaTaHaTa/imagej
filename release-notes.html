<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Plugins&gt;Macros&gt;Edit</i> command, which replaces the <i>Plugins&gt;Edit</i> command
removed in v1.41g. There is also a plugin version of the <i>Edit</i>

<li>  JavaScript programs with an underscore in the name and a ".js" extension
are installed in the Plugins menu at startup.

<li>  Opens 16-bit grayscale AVIs created by 
MIL (Matrox Imaging Library), thanks to a patch by Reinhard Mayr.
<li> Added the run("Fit Spline", "straighten") macro function, which converts a line selection to one
defined by points spaced one pixel apart
(<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/macros/examples/PlotSplineFitLine.txt">example</a>).

<li> The ROI Manager "Combine" function works with point selections.

correctly with NaN and infinite arguments.

aborting a batch mode macro by pressing Esc.

<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/developer/macro/functions.html#setOption">setOption("QueueMacros",true)</a>
macro function to not work as expectde with macros using a function key shortcut.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager "Update" option to hold a
reference to the image, preventing it from being garbage collected.
