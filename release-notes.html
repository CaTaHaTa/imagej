<li> <u>1.41b, 6 May 2008</u>
<ul>
<li>  Incorporated Michael Schmid's 
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/avi-reader.html">AVI Reader</a>
plugin. AVI files can now be opened using <i>File&gt;Open</i>,
<i>File&gt;Import&gt;AVI</i> and drag and drop.
<li> To reduce the size of the Plugins menu, JAR files that implement fewer than four
Plugins submenu commands are installed in the submenu that corresponds the
the folder containing the JAR file.
In addition, single plugins distributed as ZIP archives are installed in 
the "Miscellaneous" submenu.
<li> Johannes Hermen and Christian Mol added the ability
to parse float header values to the DICOM reader and contributed a 2652 tag dictionary
(<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/download/docs/DICOM_Dictionary.txt">DICOM_Dictionary.txt</a>)
that the DICOM reader will use if it is copied to the ImageJ folder.
<li> The DICOM reader uses the value of the "Slice Thickness" tag for 
voxel depth if the "Slice Spacing" tag is missing.
<li> The particle analyzer, when run from a batch mode macro, no longer
opens the ROI Manager window when "Add to Manager" is enabled,
resulting in faster and more reliable operation.
<li> <i>Process&gt;Enhance Contrast</i> works with composite
color images.
<li> The minimum plot size that can be set in
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Profile Plot Options</i> was reduced from 300x100 to 100x50.
<li> Added the "Restore ROIs Centered" option to the ROI Manager's 
More>>Options command.
<li> Added the Stack.setActiveChannels() macro function.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause an exception when saving composite
color images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused composite color images with custom LUTs 
to revert to the default LUTs after resaving.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused Z projection of hyperstacks to fail in batch
mode macros.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused ImageJ to not correctly read ImageJ TIFF stacks modified by LibTIFF.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused macros using <i>Analyze&gt;Surface Plot</i> plot with both the
"Draw Wireframe" and "Draw Axis" options to fail.
