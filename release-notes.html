<li> <u>1.42c, 2 December 2008</u>
<ul>
<li> Added a "Scaled Units" checkbox to the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Specify</i> dialog and
 "Pixel Units" checkboxes to the <i>Analyze&gt;Analyze Particles</i> and <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Enlarge</i>dialogs.
These checkboxes are only displayed if the image is spatially calibrated.
<li> The ROI Manager "Multi Measure" command adds the ROI name to the column headers if
the name does not start with a digit or if its length is less than nine characters.
<li> The length of the current straight line selection is now displayed in the <i>Analyze&gt;Set Scale</i> dialog
with spatially calibrated images.
<li> The getDirectory("image") macro function is more likely to work with an image loaded by an external plugin.
<li> Worked around a bug on Mac OS X that required pressing the "Remove Scale" button in the <i>Analyze&gt;Set Scale</i> dialog box.
</ul>
