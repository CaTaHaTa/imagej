<li> <u>1.39c, 7 August 2007</u>
<ul>
<li> Added a "Set Color" button to the ROI Manager's <i>More&gt;&gt;Options</i> dialog 
that sets the color used in "Show All" mode.
<li> The selection brush tool now adds to the selection if you click in it 
and subtracts from it if you click outside it. Or hold down the shift key to 
add to the selection or hold the alt key down to subtract from it. 
<li> The 
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/macros/MacroExtensions.txt">MacroExtension interface</a>,
contributed by Shannon Stewman, allows 
plugins to add functions to the macro language. As an example, the Image5D_Extensions plugin 
(<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/download/Image5D_Extensions.java">source</a>,
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/download/Image5D_Extensions.class">.class</a>)
adds functions to the macro language that deal with the Image5D plugin 
(querying and setting the channel, frame, display mode), and the
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/macros/Image5dMacros.txt">Image5dMacros</a>
use these functions.
<li> Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.38q, that caused TIFF stacks saved by the Image5D plugin to be corrupted.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused an exception when an Image5D stack was duplicated.
<li> Johannes Schindelin contributed a patch that provides a better error message and a stack trace when
a method called by the call() macro function throws an exception.
<li> Johannes Schindelin contributed patches that fix bugs in the Roi Manager "Split" command.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused 48-bit RGB TIFFs created by ImageJ to not open correctly in other applications.
<li> Michael Schmid fixed a bug in the <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Watershed</i> that could 
cause particles to disappear. A test image is
