/**
 * Defines the "visibility" of a parameter.
 * <p>
 * Choices are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>NORMAL: parameter is included in the history for purposes of data
 * provenance, and included as a parameter when recording scripts.</li>
 * <li>TRANSIENT: parameter is excluded from the history for the purposes of
 * data provenance, but still included as a parameter when recording scripts.</li>
 * <li>INVISIBLE: parameter is excluded from the history for the purposes of
 * data provenance, and also excluded as a parameter when recording scripts.
 * This option should only be used for parameters with no effect on the final
 * output, such as a "verbose" flag.</li>
 * <li>MESSAGE: as INVISIBLE, and further indicating that the parameter value is
 * intended as a message to the user (e.g., in the input harvester panel) rather
 * than an actual parameter to the plugin execution.</li>
 * </ul>
