/**
 * Interface for ImageJ tools. A tool is a collection of rules binding
 * user input (e.g., keyboard and mouse events) to display and data
 * manipulation in a coherent way. 
 *
 * For example, a {@link PanTool} might pan a display when the mouse is dragged
 * or arrow key is pressed, while a {@link PencilTool} could draw hard lines
 * on the data within a display.
 *
 * Portions of this interface were inspired by the
 * <a href="http://edndoc.esri.com/arcobjects/9.2/java/api/arcobjects/com/esri/arcgis/systemUI/ITool.html">ArcGIS ArcObjects ITool interface</a>.
