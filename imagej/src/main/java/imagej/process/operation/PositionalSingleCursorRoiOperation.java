/**
 * PositionalSingleCursorRoiOperation is the prototypical positional operation that can be done to an Image. It is
 * the base class for any operation that manipulates one value of an Image (using information about its position in
 * the Image) with no reference to any other Image. However, the implementor of this abstract interface can create
 * any reference data it needs to decide how to transform values in the Image if desired.
 * 
 * This operation works on a user defined N dimensional region of an image. It can be constrained to only
 * apply to sample values that are filtered via a user specified SelectionFunction. It will update an Observer
 * as the iteration takes place if one is attached to this operation.  
 *
 * Implementors of the abstract interface define beforeIteration(), insideIteration(), and afterIteration()
 * methods.
 * 
 * Note that Positional cursor operations are slower than their nonpositional counterparts
 * (i.e. SingleCursorRoiOperation vs. PositionalSingleCursorRoiOperation.
