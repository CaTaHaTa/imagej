import imagej.StorageType;

/** The interface for the support of all pixel data types in ImageJ. Types have some methods for querying information. They also have
 * methods for handling the storage of their data. This could be separated but keeping this info together simplifies the expansion to
 * new types when needed. To add a new type you need to define a class derived from Type, implement its methods, and implement a
 * DataAccessor for the Type. The type needs to then be added to the Types class' static initialization code (see Types.java). If a
 * new Imglib type is created and needs to be supported then the process is the same but there are a couple places in ij2-imglib that
 * also need to be tweaked. For example, imagej.imglib.process.ImageUtils::getPlaneCopy(), and
 * imagej.ij1bridge.process.ImageUtils::createProcessor() both need to be updated as they need knowledge of all Imglib types to
 * correctly create their data. Also imagej.ij1bridge.ImgLibProcessorFactory needs to be expanded to include the new Imglib type.
